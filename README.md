# ðŸ”„ 8-Puzzle Solver (Mid-Project Status)

This project implements and compares classical search algorithms to solve the **8-puzzle problem** â€” a 3x3 sliding tile puzzle where the goal is to reach a target configuration from a shuffled state by moving tiles.

---

## âœ… Objective

To evaluate and compare the **efficiency**, **optimality**, and **scalability** of the following algorithms:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**
- **A\* Search** (using Manhattan or Hamming heuristics)

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Implemented

- **BFS** â€“ Explores all nodes at the current depth before going deeper. Guarantees optimal path but uses high memory.
- **DFS** â€“ Explores as deep as possible along a branch. Uses less memory but may be suboptimal and get stuck in cycles.
- **UCS** â€“ Expands the least-cost node using a priority queue. Similar to Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
- **A\*** â€“ Informed search using `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`:
  - `g(n)` = cost to reach current node
  - `h(n)` = heuristic estimate to goal (e.g., Manhattan distance)
